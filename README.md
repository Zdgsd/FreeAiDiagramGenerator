# Free AI Diagram Generator

**By Sadok B.**

Welcome to the **Free AI Diagram Generator**, the application that exists because manually aligning rectangles in PowerPoint is a specific circle of hell that no one should have to visit.

This tool uses the Google Gemini API to read your chaotic meeting notes, bug reports, or CSV files and instantly hallucinate—I mean, *generate*—structured, professional data visualizations. It renders them in D3.js so they look crisp, sharp, and like you spent four hours on them instead of four seconds.

## The "Why"

We built this because:
1. You have data.
2. Your boss loves diagrams.
3. You love not making diagrams.

This tool bridges that gap. It analyzes text, decides what chart fits best (Auto Mode), or lets you shout specific commands at it (Manual Mode), and then hands you a vector graphic you can copy-paste directly into that report you are procrastinating on.

## Features

### 1. Auto Analyst
This is for the lazy genius. Drag and drop a CSV file, or paste a wall of text from a slack channel. The AI will:
*   Read it.
*   Understand it.
*   Write an executive summary (so you don't have to).
*   Decide which diagrams best represent the data.
*   Render them.

It's like having an intern who actually listens.

### 2. Manual Generator
For the control freaks. You select the diagram type, you type the prompt.
*   "Pareto chart of reasons why the server crashed."
*   "Fishbone diagram of why the coffee machine is always broken."
*   "Timeline of the project we started three years ago and is still in 'discovery' phase."

### 3. Supported Diagrams
*   **Ishikawa (Fishbone)**: For root cause analysis. Ideal for figuring out who to blame.
*   **Pareto Chart**: The 80/20 rule visualizer. Show management that 80% of problems come from 20% of the legacy code.
*   **Timeline / Gantt**: Visual proof that the deadline was impossible.
*   **Action Plan**: Circles connected to lines. Looks very productive.
*   **Brainwriting**: Like brainstorming, but structured, so introverts can participate.
*   **Mind Map**: A spiderweb of thoughts.
*   **SWOT**: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and "Threats" (usually competitors or lack of caffeine).
*   **Radar Chart**: For comparing skills, like "Coding Ability" vs "Willingness to attend meetings".

### 4. Dark Mode
We included a Dark Mode because we know you are likely using this tool at 2 AM in a dark room. Your retinas are safe with us.

### 5. Professional Export
*   **Copy to Clipboard**: Copies a high-res PNG to your clipboard.
*   **Download**: Saves a PNG file.
*   **No Watermarks**: We aren't monsters.

## Tech Stack

We used the good stuff. No jQuery were harmed in the making of this app.

*   **React 19**: The latest and greatest.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: Because writing actual CSS is so 2015.
*   **D3.js**: The math wizard behind the beautiful lines.
*   **Google Gemini API**: The brain.
*   **Vercel**: The host.

## Installation & Setup

If you want to run this locally and tinker with the code (or fix my bugs), follow these steps.

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (Recent version).
*   A terminal.
*   A Google Cloud Project with the Gemini API enabled.
*   A credit card (for the API key), though the free tier is usually generous enough for testing.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/free-ai-diagram-generator.git
    cd free-ai-diagram-generator
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *If this fails, try turning it off and on again.*

3.  **Environment Setup**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory. You need one specific variable. Do not share this file with the internet unless you like paying for other people's API usage.

    ```env
    API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
    ```

    *Note: The code uses `process.env.API_KEY` explicitly.*

4.  **Run it**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Open your browser to `http://localhost:1234` (or whatever port Parcel/Vite/Webpack decides to use).

## Deployment (Vercel)

This app is "Vercel Ready".

1.  Push your code to a Git repository.
2.  Import the project into Vercel.
3.  **Crucial Step**: In the Vercel Project Settings, go to **Environment Variables** and add `API_KEY` with your actual Google Gemini API key.
4.  Hit Deploy.
5.  Wait 30 seconds.
6.  Profit.

## A Note on Emojis

You will notice a distinct lack of emojis in this application and documentation. This was a deliberate design choice to maintain a facade of extreme professionalism. We are serious people doing serious diagramming business.

## License

MIT. Do whatever you want with it. Clone it, sell it, turn it into an NFT (please don't). Just give credit to **Sadok B.** if you feel generous.
